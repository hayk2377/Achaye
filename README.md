# Pharmaco
The project is inteded to make finding medicine easy. It helps users find the nearest pharmacy that has thier medicine.
## It has two main business features

* Users can search for medicine and can order to reserve it via the app. They can later pick it up themselves or get it delivered to them via other means(outside the scope of the app).
* It helps pharmacy owners display the price and amount of drugs they have in store.
